Being unaware at the time, this autoimmune disease was a precursor to a life of mystery and self-discovery, which ultimately became my greatest blessing. It took me on a journey to rediscover and reclaim my mind, body, and souls' essence that allowed me to connect with the earth's ancient knowledge. I believe everything we are meant to experience is just an opportunity to lead us back home to our most authentic self, our true self."

            description: " 2012 was a pivotal year. It was the year I began to question everything about all things. Through this awakening, I discovered how much work needed to be done. I had to actively undo all the programming and limiting beliefs encoded within my mind, and even more within my body. This was just the beginning of my homecoming."

            description: " In 2018 I began my studies in hypnosis with the great Dolores Cannon, which provided me with an extensive background in Past-Life Hypnosis. This opened my eyes to an entirely different perspective regarding the way we think about ourselves and the impact it has on our past, present, and future. Understanding that every thought holds a specific energetic imprint, which then creates our reality, was truly fascinating. We can change our lives in an instance with this profound understanding."
